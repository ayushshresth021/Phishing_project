# Phishing_project

Our approach to combat this problem of phishing is to detect these emails using trained Machine Learning models to determine whether it believes itâ€™s a phishing email or not.

**Architecture, Design, and Key Algorithm**

**Phishing Email Detection Models**<br>
  Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forests Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier (Gaussian)<br>
  Datasets: Kaggle and https://monkey.org/~jose/phishing/<br>
  Feed vectorized text into the machine learning models<br>
  Email text extractor<br>
**Phishing URL Detection Models**<br>
  Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forests Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier (Gaussian), Feedforward Neural Network<br>
  Dataset: Kaggle<br>
  Feed a vector of 10 features into the machine learning models<br>
Tools: <br>
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Numpy libraries<br>
